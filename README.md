This package provides constants and functions for implementing the [IETF RFC5988 standard for Web Linking](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988).

This is a personal experiment to explore the WebFinger protocol.  This library is BRAND NEW, and is not ready for use **by anyone**, for **any reason**, at **any time**.  Check out https://github.com/go-fed for a library that's ready for prime time.
